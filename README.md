# Fraud-Detection-On-Bank-Payments

I have divided my project into four phases. 
In phase 1: I have used Data Analysis on my dataset which is data cleaning, data visualization, normalization using python. 
Phase 2: Building a Model: I have created basic machine learning models just to see performance and accuracy. 
Phase 3: Model Selection and Evaluation, I have created more than 30 different deep learning models just to play around and see the performance of the models and from that, I have selected one best model based on the learning curves and accuracy. 
Phase 4: Applied Feature Importance and Reduction.
